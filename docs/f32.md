# Misbehaving `f32` values

When the NodeJS host environment echoes an `f32` value such as `Math.PI` into a WebAssembly function (expecting to get the same value back), the `.wasm` function returns a slightly different value with a discrepancy less than about <code>1 x 10<sup>-7</sup></code>.

## Example Using JavaScript's `Math.PI`

In JavaScript when you need the value of pi, you can reference `Math.PI` and this will give you back the value `3.141592653589793`

However, if you write this value to shared memory, then get a WASM function to read that value and give it back to you, you get back `3.1415927410125732` instead.

I haven't yet discovered the cause of this discrepancy; so for the time being, I have simply coded around it.
Hence, some tests pass with the message `passed within acceptable floating point tolerance`.
